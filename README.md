# Dota match outcome prediction

Dota 2 is a highly competitive 5 versus 5 computer game. Before the game begins, each of the 10 players must choose a hero out of a 116 hero pool; even though the match outcome is largely a matter of the players' skills, these first hero choices have the capacity to give one team a significant advantage throughout the match.

The model built here uses public match data (of the top 10% ranked players) to predict the match outcome (win/lose) given these 10 hero choices.
